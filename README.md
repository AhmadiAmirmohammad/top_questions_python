# Python Interview Questions
**1. How will you improve the performance
of a program in Python?**

- There are many ways to improve the performance of a Python
program. Some of these are as follows:
    - **Data Structure:** We have to select the right data structure
    for our purpose in a Python program.
    - **Standard Library:** Wherever possible, we should use
    methods from standard library. Methods implemented in standard library have much better performance than user
    implementation.
    - **Abstraction:** At times, a lot of abstraction and
    indirection can cause slow performance of a program.
    We should remove the redundant abstraction in code.
    - **Algorithm:** Use of right algorithm can make a big
    difference in a program. We have to find and select the
    suitable algorithm to solve our problem with high
    performance.

**2. What are the benefits of using Python?**

- Python is strong that even Google uses it. Some of the benefits of using
Python are as follows:
    - **Efficient:** Python is very efficient in memory
    management. For a large data set like Big Data, it is much
    easier to program in Python.
    - **Faster:** Though Python code is interpreted, still Python
    has very fast performance.
    - **Wide usage:** Python is widely used among different
    organizations for different projects. Due to this wide
    usage, there are thousands of add-ons available for use
    with Python.
    - **Easy to learn:** Python is quite easy to learn. This is the
    biggest benefit of using Python. Complex tasks can be
    very easily implemented in Python.

**3. How will you specify source code
encoding in a Python source file?**
- By default, every source code file in Python is in UTF-8 encoding. But we
can also specify our own encoding for source files. This can be done by
adding following line after #! line in the source file.
```
# -*- coding: encoding -*-
```
- In the above line we can replace encoding with the encoding that we want
to use.
example is:
```
# -*- coding: latin-1 -*-
```

**4. What is the use of PEP 8 in Python?**
- PEP 8 is a style guide for Python code. This document provides the coding
conventions for writing code in Python. Coding conventions are about
indentation, formatting, tabs, maximum line length, imports organization,
line spacing etc. 
- We use PEP 8 to bring consistency in our code. We
consistency it is easier for other developers to read the code.

**5. What is Pickling in Python?**
- Pickling is a process by which a Python object hierarchy can be converted
into a byte stream. The reverse operation of Pickling is Unpickling.
Python has a module named pickle. This module has the implementation of
a powerful algorithm for serialization and de-serialization of Python object
structure.
- Some people also call Pickling as Serialization or Marshalling.
With Serialization we can transfer Python objects over the network. It is
also used in persisting the state of a Python object. We can write it to a file
or a database.
