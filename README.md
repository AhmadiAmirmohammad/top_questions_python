1. How will you improve the performance
of a program in Python?
There are many ways to improve the performance of a Python
program. Some of these are as follows:
- Data Structure: We have to select the right data structure
for our purpose in a Python program.
 Standard Library: Wherever possible, we should use
methods from standard library. Methods implemented in
- standard library have much better performance than user
implementation.
- Abstraction: At times, a lot of abstraction and
indirection can cause slow performance of a program.
We should remove the redundant abstraction in code.
- Algorithm: Use of right algorithm can make a big
difference in a program. We have to find and select the
suitable algorithm to solve our problem with high
performance.
